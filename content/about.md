I was born in Newport Beach in 1986... I know... a century ago. Growing up, I was constantly surrounded by computers and technology. At the age of 6, I was gifted a blazing fast 286 4Mhz system rocking a massive 4MB of RAM and the latest version of MS-DOS. It powered through SimAnt and SimCity (the original) with no difficulty.

In 1995, I discovered my dad's Visual Basic 3 CD-ROM and installed it to experiment. I had no idea what I was doing, but drawing buttons on forms and making them change colors on clicks was fascinating. Later in 1995, I discovered Geocities and joined the hordes of people with their own little space on the internet rocking the animated GIF "Under Construction" pages. In 1997, I discovered IRC and began tinkering with IRCds and services followed shortly by Linux and FreeBSD. In 1998, I convinced my dad to allow me to replace our old Windows NT 4.0 home proxy server with a Slackware Linux system that handled NAT and DHCP and from then on, I was an avid Linux user. I did experiment with FreeBSD off and on, but always found myself back on Linux.

In High School, I was your stereotypical computer nerd. Tried to start a Lord of the Rings club, was part of the "IT staff" on Yearbook, ran the school's website and lead the team of 5-10 students during my Junior and Senior years, was a percussionist in the school's band and part of drumline for Marching Band. I was part of everything not "cool and popular".

In 2008, I joined the US Navy and served as an Air Traffic Controller until separating in 2015. From there, I joined the FAA as an Air Traffic Controller until deciding to turn my computer knowledge from a hobby into a career. I started as a Linux Support Engineer for Brainspace in 2019 and have since joined Solo.io as a Software Engineer working on innovative technology such as Istio and Ambient Mesh.
